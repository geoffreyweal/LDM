# Literature Data Mining (LDM): A Guide for Automatically Downloading and Highlighting Literature on Mass

This program is designed to help you to data mine the literature. There are several components to this tutorial

1. Installation of VirtualBox and downloading virtual machine containing the LDM Program
2. Using VirtualBox and opening the Virtual Machine
3. Setting up the LDM program
4. Running the LDM program

If you are attending a tutorial based on learning literature data mining, make sure you have done steps 1 and 2 before attending.

## 1. Installation

### 1.1: Install VirtualBox

To use the LDM, we will be using VirtualBox. VirtualBox is a program that allows you to run an operating system within your computer. This program is very useful if you can only run a program in certain operating systems. You will need to install this program on your computer. 

See https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads to download and install VirtualBox on your computer. 

### 1.2: Download the LDM Virtual Machine

We will now download the LDM virtual machine to your computer. This virtual machine contains a version of Ubuntu (Linux) that we will run the LDM on. 

Download this virtual machine by downloading the contents from this OneDrive link onto your computer (You will ne about 20 GB of space on your computer. Make sure you have a good internet link when downloading this file): https://vuw-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/wealge_staff_vuw_ac_nz/Epbk95CbqRNOm_iSvEVcy7cBlmXJzTJRtMEsAGnkH39Ljw?e=BoigGO

## 2. Using VirtualBox and opening the Virtual Machine

### 2.1: Adding the LDM Virtual Machine to your VirtualBox

First, we will add the LDM virtual machine to your VirtualBox:

1. Open the VirtualBox program.
2. Click the green + icon called add.

</p>

You have now added the LDM virtual machine to your VirtualBox. You will see the LDM in your VirtualBox list of virtual machines.

### 2.2: Setting Up the Shared Folder 

We will now set up a folder on your computer that we will be working in. This folder will allow us to add data to the virtual machine, manipulate data, and copy data and pdf files from the LDM program.

### 2.3: Starting Up the LDM Virtual Machine

We will now turn on the LDM Virtual Machine. Click on the LDM virtual machine and then click the green  <kbd>Right</kbd> icon called show.

</p>

A new window contains the LDM virtual machine will now begin. This will look like a computer is turning on. It is ready when the virtual machine looks like below:
