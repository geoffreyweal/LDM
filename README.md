# Literature Data Mining: A Guide for Automatically Downloading and Highlighting Literature on Mass

This workbook is designed to help you use programs developed for performing data mining on literature. 

This workbook uses the `ScrapPaper` program that were originally developed by M. R. Rafsanjani. See https://github.com/rafsanlab/ScrapPaper and https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.08.483427

## How to use these notebooks

These notebooks are run in Google Colab, which works like Microsoft Word but you can also perform computer programs with them. We will be using a computer program called Python for performing data mining on literature. 

To begin you will first click on the *Open in Colab* button below. This will open a notebook in Google Colab, and will tell you what to do next! Google Colabs only run on a website. **Google Colab will not be installed on your computer and will not install anything on your computer.**
